# 👨‍💻 My Cybersecurity Journey

Hi there! I'm ygoncloud, and welcome to my GitHub! 🚀  
I'm on a passionate journey through the world of **Cybersecurity**, exploring both **Offensive** and **Defensive Security** to build a deep, well-rounded understanding of how to protect digital systems from real-world threats.

## 🛡️ Defensive Security Focus

I’m currently diving deep into the **Blue Team** side of cybersecurity, learning how to **prevent**, **detect**, and **respond** to threats.

### Core Topics I'm Studying:
- 🔍 **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
  - Threat detection
  - Incident response
  - Real-time monitoring
- 🌐 **Threat Intelligence**
  - Understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
  - Evidence collection and analysis
  - Incident handling lifecycle
- 🦠 **Malware Analysis**
  - Reverse engineering
  - Identifying malware behavior

### Hands-On Skills:
- Patching and securing systems
- Setting up logging and monitoring tools
- Documenting and managing IT assets
- Training users in cybersecurity awareness

## 💣 Offensive Security Exploration

To better understand how to defend, I also explore **Red Team** and **Penetration Testing** methodologies.

### Topics I’m Learning:
- Exploiting common software vulnerabilities
- Testing insecure configurations
- Bypassing access control mechanisms

Tools I'm playing with:  
`nmap` • `Metasploit` • `Burp Suite` • `Wireshark` • `Hydra` • `Kali Linux`

## 🛠️ Projects & Labs

I regularly work on hands-on labs and side projects to apply what I learn:

- ✅ SOC & SIEM Simulation Labs
- ✅ Malware Reverse Engineering Projects
- ✅ Penetration Testing Practice Environments (e.g., TryHackMe, HackTheBox)
- ✅ Bash/Python Scripts for Automation and Analysis

> “The best defense is a deep understanding of the offense.”

## 📚 Learning Platforms I Use
- TryHackMe
- HackTheBox
- BlueTeamLabs
- PortSwigger Academy
- YouTube channels like John Hammond & IppSec

---

## 📌 What's Next?
I plan to:
- Get certified (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CySA+, or OSCP)
- Contribute to open-source security tools
- Share write-ups, notes, and scripts here on GitHub
