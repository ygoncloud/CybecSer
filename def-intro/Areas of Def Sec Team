# Defensive Security Notes

## 1. Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals responsible for **monitoring, detecting, and responding** to threats across networks and systems.

### Key Responsibilities of a SOC:

- **Vulnerabilities**
  - Monitor for system weaknesses.
  - Ensure timely patching and remediation.
  - Apply mitigation strategies if patches are unavailable.
  - Note: Remediation may not be directly handled by SOC.

- **Policy Violations**
  - Enforce and monitor adherence to security policies.
  - Example: Uploading sensitive data to unauthorized cloud storage.

- **Unauthorized Activity**
  - Detect and respond to account compromises (e.g., stolen credentials).
  - Take action before attackers can escalate or cause damage.

- **Network Intrusions**
  - Identify and contain intrusions quickly.
  - Examples: Clicking malicious links or exploiting public-facing servers.

### Threat Intelligence

- Integral part of SOC operations.
- Involves collecting, analyzing, and acting on information about existing or emerging threats.
- Helps in proactive defense and informed incident response.
