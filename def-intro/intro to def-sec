# Offensive vs. Defensive Security

## Offensive Security

**Goal:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities to improve overall security posture.

### Common Techniques:
- Exploiting software bugs.
- Leveraging insecure system configurations.
- Bypassing or abusing weak access control policies.

### Key Teams:
- **Red Team:** Simulates real-world attacks to test defenses.
- **Penetration Testing Team:** Conducts controlled attacks to find vulnerabilities.

## Defensive Security

**Goal:** 
1. Prevent intrusions before they occur.
2. Detect and respond effectively to intrusions when they happen.

### Key Team:
- **Blue Team:** Defends systems against real-world attacks and helps maintain a secure environment.

### Common Tasks:
1. Promoting user cybersecurity awareness.
2. Documenting and managing IT assets.
3. Keeping systems up-to-date and patched.
4. Deploying preventative security devices (e.g., firewalls).
5. Implementing logging and monitoring systems.

### Advanced Areas in Defensive Security:
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- **Threat Intelligence**
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**
- **Malware Analysis**
